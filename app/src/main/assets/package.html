<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    This is a Java port of the MusicBrainz API, written by
    Leigh Dodds (<a href="mailto:leigh@ldodds.com">leigh@ldodds.com</a>,
    <a href="http://www.ldodds.com">http://www.ldodds.com</a>). For more
    information about the MusicBrainz project see: <a href="http://www.musicbrainz.org">http://www.musicbrainz.org</a>.
</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>
    The MusicBrainz web service has two types of query: those that are accessible
    via an HTTP GET request -- these take a unique artist/album/track identifier
    in the URL path info -- and those that are accessible via an HTTP POST request.
    The latter involving posting an RDF document describing the query to a CGI
    application, which will then return an RDF document describing the results.
</p>

<p>
    The details on constructing a MusicBrainz query, including constructing
    the RDF query documents, is totally encapsulated within the provided implementation
    ({@link com.ldodds.musicbrainz.MusicBrainz}, {@link com.ldodds.musicbrainz.MusicBrainzImpl},
    {@link com.ldodds.musicbrainz.Templates}).
</p>

<p>
    The responses from the web service are made available in two formats: as
    "raw" RDF (actually Jena 2 Model instances) or via some simple JavaBeans
    ({@link com.ldodds.musicbrainz.Artist}, {@link com.ldodds.musicbrainz.Album},
    {@link com.ldodds.musicbrainz.Track}, {@link com.ldodds.musicbrainz.TrackSummary}). These
    JavaBeans are instantiated by a factory class ({@link com.ldodds.musicbrainz.BeanPopulator}) which is capable
    of navigating the
    RDF graph returned by different MusicBrainz queries and pulling out the
    required data.
</p>

<p>
    This means that you can choose to ignore the RDF details if you'd prefer, or
    dig around in the results and perform operations on the RDF graph.
</p>

<p>
    Most of the MusicBrainz queries have a "depth" parameter. This equates to
    setting the level of detail in the results. For example when querying about
    an Album, do you also want details of all tracks, the artist, and possibly
    other albums by the same artist? Increasing the depth parameter increases
    the level of detail. As a rough guide, 2 is a "shallow" query, 4 is a
    medium query and 6 is a "deep" query. Play with the level of detail to get a
    feel for what's returned in different cases. However you should try to carefully
    select the depth of your query to make sure that you only retrieve as much information
    as you really need.
</p>

<h3>The "Raw RDF" Interface</h3>

<p>
    Accessing the RDF data directly is very straight-forward. Firstly create
    an implementation of the {@link com.ldodds.musicbrainz.MusicBrainz} interface:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    MusicBrainz server = new MusicBrainzImpl();
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    There is only a single implementation provided in this API ({@link com.ldodds.musicbrainz.MusicBrainImpl}).
    The object has an alternate constructor that allows you to specify the host
    name of the MusicBrainz server, in case you need to connect to a mirror.
</p>

<p>
    Next we perform a query:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    //name of an album
    String name = "Second Toughest In The Infants";
    //medium query
    int depth = 4;
    //maximum number of items to return
    int maxItems = 1;

    Model results = server.findAlbumByName(name, depth, maxItems);
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    The <code>maxItems</code> parameter, which is accepted by several methods, indicates to
    the MusicBrainz server how many results it can return. E.g. if there are
    two albums with similar names, can it return both or just the first?
    There is no way to fetch <i>all</i> matches, other than setting maxItems to
    be an arbitrarily large value.
</p>

<p>
    At present the MusicBrainz web service supports wildcarding (% = zero or
    more characters). However it is possible that this may change in the
    future, so use with care.
</p>

<p>
    At this point you have a Jena Model containing the results. This will
    basically be an {@link com.ldodds.musicbrainz.MQ.Result mq:Result} which has an
    {@link com.ldodds.musicbrainz.MQ.trackList mq:trackList},
    {@link com.ldodds.musicbrainz.MQ.artistList mq:artistList}, or {@link com.ldodds.musicbrainz.MQ.albumList mq:albumList} property.
    Examine {@link com.ldodds.musicbrainz.MM} and {@link com.ldodds.musicbrainz.MQ} to see what RDF classes and properties the
    MusicBrainz service can return.
</p>

<h3>The Bean Interface</h3>

<p>
    Using the Bean interface involves exactly the same steps as using the
    RDF server above, with the addition of one extra line of code:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    List albums = BeanPopulator.getAlbums(model);
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    This invokes a method on the BeanPopulator factory class, asking it to
    extract the metadata (in this example, an <code>mm:Album</code>) from the graph.
    The factory will create instances of the Album, Artist and Track beans
    and populate them with the results. With "deep" queries you'll find that
    an Artists and Tracks will be associated with their Albums, so you can
    do the following:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    Album album = albums.get(0);
    Artist artist = album.getArtist();
    List tracks = album.getTracks();
    //process the results...
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    This alternate interface means that the details of the underlying RDF
    data is totally hidden.
</p>

<p>
    Note that at present the unique identifiers stored in the beans are the raw identifiers,
    and not URIs.
</p>

<p>
    For more examples of how to use the bean interface, see the unit tests.
    There is one test for each MusicBrainz query.
</p>

<h2>Known Bugs and Limitations</h2>

<p>
    The initial version of this API only supports a subset of the MusicBrainz
    API. Specifically it does not yet support the Authenticate and Submit
    requests required to actually submit new entries into the database. It also
    does not yet support the FileInfoLookup function. Later versions of this API
    will support all functionality. At present the API is read-only, but is
    complete enough to develop Java based applications.
</p>

<p>
    The {@link MusicBrainz#findDistinctTRMId} implementation is untested as there appears
    to be a bug in the MusicBrainz server code that makes this result always return no
    results. See <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/archives/irc/musicbrainz/2003-09-16.html#T22-21-14">IRC logs</a>.
</p>

<p>
    The {@link MusicBrainz#getTrackInfoFromTRMId} implementation works, but has not
    had adequate testing as there appears to be some data errors in the MusicBrainz
    database: specifically the same trmid associated with the same track more than once.
    See <a href="http://musicbrainz.org/archives/irc/musicbrainz/2003-09-16.html#T21-57-32">IRC logs</a>
